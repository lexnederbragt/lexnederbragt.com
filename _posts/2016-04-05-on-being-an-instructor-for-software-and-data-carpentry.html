<p>I was recently asked to provide a testimonial on why I am an instructor for <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> and <a href="datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Teaching in general, and at Software and Data Carpentry workshops in particular, gives me great pleasure and is one of the most personally rewarding activities I engage in. With Software Carpentry, I feel I belong to a community that shares many of the same values I have: openness, tolerance, a focus on quality in teaching to name a few. The instructor training program is the best pedagogical program I know of, and it is amazing to see how Software and Data Carpentry are building a community of educators that are fully grounded in the research on educational practices.</p>
<p>Being an instructor is my way of making a small, but hopefully significant, contribution to improving science, and thus the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>This testimonial can also be found <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/instructors.html">here</a>.</p>

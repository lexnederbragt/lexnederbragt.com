<p>For three platforms, reads longer than the commercially available, and/or from not-yet released instruments, have become accessible online. With online, I mean that we all can download these data to have a look at:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">1) MiSeq 2x 150 bases runs</span><br />
As part of the German E. Coli (EHEC) 'Crowdsourcing Project', Illumina sequenced fie strains for the UK Health Protection Agency, the fastq files can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.hpa-bioinformatics.org.uk/lgp/genomes">http://www.hpa-bioinformatics.org.uk/lgp/genomes</a>. These are the first data in the public domain from a MiSeq!<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2) IonTorrent 316 chip</span><br />
Keith Robison shares a bit of info on data from an Ion 316 chip ion his <a href="http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/2011/06/first-peek-at-data-from-ion-316-chip.html">'Omics! Omic!' blog</a>: "1.69M reads, with 1.53M of those &gt;=50 bp long and 1.07M 100bp or longer":<br />
I <a href="https://iontorrent.box.net/shared/dgjscpc8o9ic1u8uky4f">downloaded the run files</a>, and quickly looked at the read length distribution of the trimmed reads in the sff file (which listed 260 flows, 40 more than the file I analyzed in <a href="/2011/06/16/there-is-more-length-to-ion-torrent-reads-than-meets-the-eye-and-is-ion-torrent-hiding-it-2/">my previous post</a>), showing a peak exactly one base longer at 109 bases. So, many more reads but not much gain in length (yet). Note the strange shape of the peak:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">3) 454 GS FLX+</span><br />
As part of the assemblathon2 (a de novo assembly <a href="http://assemblathon.org/pages/rules">competition</a>), there have been released the first GS FLX+ reads (from a parrot), peak read length around 736 bases: <a href="http://bioshare.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/Data/hcbxz0i7kg/Parrot/">http://bioshare.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/Data/hcbxz0i7kg/Parrot/</a>. Those are at Sanger read length, now!</p>
<p>Now I need to find the time to have a look at these data!</p>

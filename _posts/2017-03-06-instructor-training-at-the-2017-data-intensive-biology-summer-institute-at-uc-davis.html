<p>[AdaptedÂ from Titus Brown's <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-dibsi-instructor-training.html">blog post</a>]</p>
<p><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/">Titus Brown</a> has been so kind as to invite me to co-instruct <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/instructor-training.html">this week-long workshop</a> (thanks!). So I thought to make a bit of a commercial for it:</p>
<p>Are you interested in</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting started with, or getting better at, teaching the Analysis of High Throughput Sequencing Data</li>
<li>Hands-on training in good pedagogical practice</li>
<li>Becoming a certified Software/Data Carpentry instructor</li>
<li>Learning how to repurpose and remix online training materials for your own needs</li>
</ul>
<p>... then this one-week workshop is for you!</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> June 18-June 25, 2017 (likely we'll only use Monday-Friday).<br />
<strong>Where:</strong> University of California, Davis, USA<br />
<strong>Instructors:</strong> Karen Word, C. Titus Brown, and Lex Nederbragt</p>
<p>This workshop is intended for people interested in teaching, reusing<br />
and repurposing the <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/">Software Carpentry</a>, <a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/">Data Carpentry</a>, or <a href="https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/">Analyzing High Throughput Sequencing Data</a> materials. We envision this course being most useful to current teaching-intensive faculty, future teachers and trainers, and core facilities that are developing training materials.</p>
<p>Attendees will learn about and gain practice implementing evidence-based teaching practices. Common pitfalls specific to novice-level instruction and bioinformatics in particular will be discussed, along with associated troubleshooting strategies. Content used in prior <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/ANGUS.html">ANGUS</a> workshops on Analyzing High Throughput Sequencing Data will be used for all practice instruction, and experienced instructors will be on hand to address questions about implementation.</p>
<p>Attendees of this workshop may opt to remain at the following <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/ANGUS.html">ANGUS</a> two-week workshops so that they can gain hands-on experience in preparing and teaching a lesson.</p>
<p>This week-long training will also serve as <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/">Software/Data Carpentry Instructor Training</a>.</p>
<p>Attendees should have significant familiarity with molecular biology and basic experience with the command line.</p>
<p>We anticipate a class size of approximately 25, with 3-6 instructors.</p>
<p>The official course website is <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/instructor-training.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfC1MphcIhfNQzJKrbuuMBePTF0FFB_t3XJzYeWpMn1hWdxTQ/viewform">Apply here!</a></h2>
<p>Applications will close <strong>March 17th</strong>.</p>
<p>The course fee will be $350 for this workshop. On campus housing may not be available for this workshop, but if it is, room and board will be approximately $500/wk additional (see <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/VENUE.html">venue information</a>). (Alternatives will include local hotels and Airbnb.)</p>

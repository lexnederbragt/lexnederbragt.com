<p>I recieved an email today via the assemblathon mailing list. Erich Jarvis, from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, wrote that he had asked somebody at Pacific Biosciences for some feedback on <a href="%20/2011/07/04/the-longest-reads-yet-a-look-at-pacbios-contribution-to-the-assemblathon/">my previous post</a> regarding the PacBio parrot reads.</p>
<p>There are a few things in the response worth repeating here.</p>
<p><!--more-->First, it was pointed out that, with an per-read accuracy of 85%, phred quality values of 8-11 are to be expected. I had already realised this when I considered that a phred score of 10 means a 1:10 chance of a base being wrong, i.e. a 90% accuracy. For a phred score of 8, these numbers are 1 in 10 to the power of 0.8 error possibility, this is 1:6.3, or 16%, or 84% accuracy.</p>
<p>Second, the errors are spread randomly over a read, meaning that a little extra coverage (5x and more) should get rid of them.</p>
<p>Third, the PacBio person wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a bit unfortunate that existing 2nd generation tools do not work well with this error profile and the short-read/high-accuracy mindset takes a while to adjust to the characteristic of our reads.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could not agree more with that second part. In a way, I deliberately took a naive look at the PacBio reads, with the mindset of second-generation reads (I love the 'short-read/high accuracy' description...). The PacBio data is in a different league, a totally different error model, but potentially very long reads. There also is a very nice option to obtain high-quality reads using circular consensus sequencing, as shown for <a href="http://blog.pacificbiosciences.com/2011/06/smrt-technology.html">the E coli data just released by PacBio</a>.</p>
<p>So, new tools are needed to work with these data, and I am eagerly looking forward to get the PacBio software installed (which will have to wait till after my holidays).</p>
<p>Finally, putting my 'sequencing core facility hat' on, we already are getting questions from our users along the lines of "when this machine finally arrives, can I then use it for this and this project?". Often, the expectations are unrealistically high. It will be my and my colleagues' task to guide these people into a direction that will get them the best results for their money.</p>
<p>As with second-generation sequencing, getting the data will be relatively easy (and cheap), making sense out of it will be something different alltogether...</p>

<p>In December last year, I <a href="/2012/12/03/developments-in-next-generation-sequencing-a-visualisation/">posted</a> a visualisation of the developments in high-throughput sequencing on this blog. In this field the technologies change rapidly, so it is about time for an update. Here is the October 2013 installment. Full run throughput in gigabases (billion bases) is plotted against single-end read length, both on a log scale:</p>

<p><strong><!--more-->Notable changes from the December 2012 edition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PacBio RS was upgraded to RS II, making for the most significant change IMHO</li>
<li>Illumina MiSeq reached 2x300 bp read length</li>
<li>I added the Illumina HiSeq2500 Rapid Run mode at 2x150 bp</li>
<li>The Ion Torrent PGM chips upgraded to V2 and got 400 bp read lengths</li>
<li>The SOLiD came out with a dual FlowChip instrument (5500xl W)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some comments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2012/12/03/developments-in-next-generation-sequencing-a-visualisation/">as mentioned in the original blog post</a>: some data was obtained by going to previous versions of company websites through the Internet Archive</li>
<li>I used full single-run specs with maximally stated throughput</li>
<li>sometimes, the total numbers of reads per full run and total bases obtained do not match up; for the figure, I always chose the reported throughput in bases</li>
<li>for Illumina, I chose to use the single-end read length, although the maximum throughput was based on the sum of all reads from a paired end run; I felt it unfair to double the read length for this platform for the figure</li>
</ul>

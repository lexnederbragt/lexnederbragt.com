I am a self-taught bioinformatician with a firm background in biology. In my work, I analyse data from high-throughput sequencing instruments, specialising in *de novo* assembly of small and large genomes. I had a central role in the sequencing and assembly of the Atlantic cod genome.

At The Centre for Evolutionary and Ecological Synthesis ([CEES](http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/)) at the University of Oslo ([UiO](www.uio.no)), where I am the lead bioinformatician, I work on the genomics of atlantic cod and other species and on new ways to represent and analyse genomic information. At the Institute for Biosciences ([IBV](http://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/)), I teach bioinformatics at the master/PHD level, and programming/modelling for first year bachelor students in Biosciences. For my 20% associate professor position at the Department of Informatics ([IFI](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/)), I teach analysis of sequencing data and (co-)supervise PhD and master students. 

I have an analytical mind that loves problem solving. I value honesty and professionalism, and dislike hype. I believe that sharing and openness will further science more than competition. I choose impact over impact factor.

I am a Software Carpentry instructor, teaching computational lab skills to scientists [at UiO](http://uio.no/carpentry) and in the Nordic countries. I am an advocate of open source software, and reproducible computational biology. I share my work not only through publications, but also on [my science blog](http://flxlexblog.wordpress.com/). My presentations can be found on [slideshare](http://slideshare.com/flxlex) and [figshare](https://figshare.com/collections/Slides_of_my_talks_presentations/3488832), and I am active on twitter (@lexnederbragt).

I am a Senior Lecturer ('Førstelektor') at the Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo. I am also head of education and training for the Centre for Bioinformatics, Dept. of Informatics, Univ. of Oslo.

At the Dept. of Biosciences, I lead the implementation of Computing in Science Education in the bachelor degree. As part of that I organise the first-semester course "Introduction to Computational Modelling for the Biosciences" (BIOS1100), teaching new Bioscience students mathematical modeling of biological problems using Python.

For the Centre for Bioinformatics, I develop and coordinate a portfolio of credited courses as well as workshops for master and PhD students and other staff.

I am a self-taught bioinformatician with a firm background in biology. My research at the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis ([CEES](https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/)) at the Dept. of Biosciences is on new methods to represent (reference) genomic information. I previously had a central role in the sequencing and assembly of the Atlantic cod genome. I lead the Advisory Council for eInfrastructure ([fagrådet for eInfrastruktur](www.uio.no/for-ansatte/nettverk-moter/los-enhetene/forskningsinfrastruktur/einfrastruktur/)) at UiO.

I am a Software Carpentry instructor, teaching computational lab skills to scientists in the Nordic countries. I am an advocate of open source software, and reproducible computational biology. I share my work not only through publications, but also on my science blog at lexnederbragt.com. My presentations can be found on [figshare](figshare.com/collections/Slides_of_my_talks_presentations/3488832) and [slideshare](http://slideshare.com/flxlex), and I am active on twitter ([@lexnederbragt](https://twitter.com/lexnederbragt)).

I have an analytical mind that loves problem solving. I value honesty and professionalism, and dislike hype. I believe that sharing and openness will further science more than competition. I choose impact over impact factor.

<p>Welcome to my blog on Biology, sequencing, bioinformatics and more. I'll post snippets of codes, ideas, perhaps discuss a paper or two, or write about anything else that I want to get off my chest. Basically, anything that happens 'In between lines of code'...</p>

<p>My name is Lex Nederbragt and I work at the University of Oslo at the Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis (<a href="http://www.cees.uio.no/">CEES</a>). My salary actually comes from the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (NSC, www.sequencing.uio.no), a HTS (or NGS) sequencing provider of which CEES is one of the two hosts.</p>
<p>Research wise, I am interested in <em>de novo</em> genome assembly (e.g. for the <a href="http://codgenome.no">cod genome project</a>), and using genomes for evolutionary studies. For my bioinformatics work, I mainly use perl, awk, and sed and am just starting to learn python. Oh, and I am a MAC person...</p>
<p>On <a href="http://contig.wordpress.com/">my other blog</a>, I present a kind of manual for the newbler program from 454 Life Science. Newbler is written for <em>de novo</em> assemblies of 454 pyrosequencing data. On this blog, I might share some tricks and tips related to working with 454 data and newbler assemblies.</p>
<p>Finally, you might know me from the internet under my pseudonym <a href="http://flavors.me/flxlex">flxlex</a>.</p>

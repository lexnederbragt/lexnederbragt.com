title: Posting and commenting policy
---

Current version: November 2018

This version of the site policy was posted in November 2018 and applies going
forward from then.

The text was adapted from [Titus Brown's blog](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-site-policies.html), who based it on [Captain Awkward's site policy](http://captainawkward.com/site-policies-and-faqs/).

I'm open to suggestions for additions and removals; please post them in
comments. However, this set of policies stands until I change them -
thanks for abiding by them!

Mission Statement
-----------------

The goal of this posting and commenting policy is to help move my
blogspace towards being a more participatory and friendly space.

Much of the value I find in writing blog posts comes from the responses
and feedback I receive on the blog posts, and ensuing conversations.
This, in turn, depends on people being willing to engage in discussions
openly, honestly, and in good faith. The policy below is my current best
effort towards defining a policy that encourages an atmosphere
supportive of this behavior.


Copyright and License
---------------------

I own the copyright to all of my writing. Guest bloggers retain their
own copyright. Quote all of us freely! Link & attribute always!

All writings posted on this blog are posted under
[CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode.txt)
unless listed otherwise at the top or bottom of the post.

Questions
---------

By posting your comments to the blog you are granting me the right, in
perpetuity, to use, quote, alter, and/or display those questions and
comments however I see fit both for commercial and non-commercial
distribution. If this concerns you, use a pseudonym and remove
identifying details before you send, or simply post a link to your own
blog.

I do not share your personal email address or identity, with one
exception: People who threaten or harass me or other posters will have
their names, emails, and IP addresses shared with their internet service
providers and, if necessary, law enforcement.

Comments Policy
---------------

I retain the right to moderate comments. Not every point of view deserves
to be heard. Unmoderated spaces tend to be full of bad behaviour.

Anonymous posting is allowed. Using a consistent identity is encouraged.

Your comments will theoretically show up immediately, though the spam
filter may eat legitimate comments, even by regular posters. Alert me
[via e-mail](contact) if one of your comments doesn't appear.

Of course, sometimes comments don't show up because I delete them. This
is a dictatorship, and I can delete any comment at any time for any
reason, and I have no time for rules lawyers. There may not be a warning
or explanation of why your comment was deleted.

A non-comprehensive list of some common reasons comments are deleted:

-   You're derailing a thread.

-   The discussion has become uncivil and has devolved into personal
    insults, threats, advocating violence, or turned into a pile-on.

-   Sarcasm, curse words, gentle mocking, criticism and vehement
    disagreement are generally allowed, as long as the overall spirit is
    constructive and in good faith.

-   You're otherwise being useless, uninformative, or destructive.

Having your comment deleted or being asked to stop commenting in a
particular thread or to move on from a topic of discussion is IN NO WAY
an invitation for you to send me lengthy emails detailing your thoughts.

You can [always reach me](contact).
